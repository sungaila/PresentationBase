# PresentationBase
A lightweight MVVM implementation for WPF ([Windows Presentation Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation)) targeting both **.NET Framework 4.8** and **.NET Core 3.1**.

It contains base implementations for *view models* (and their *commands*), frequently used *value converters*, useful *XAML markup extensions* and more. I consider these as a bare minimum when I start professional or free time WPF projects.

A sample project can be found here: [SUBSTitute](https://github.com/sungaila/SUBSTitute). Feel free to grab it from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PresentationBase) or to fork it for your own needs!
